	// really make sense.

	// Sets initial_count as it was done during the constructor. This is 
	// in the sense that it will change the current state of the latch,
	// but client code calling this while a wait() is just waking up means that if
	// the intent was to prevent that wake, then there's a race condition in the
	// client code. Use this only when it is know there aren't concurrent calls to 
	// reference or release or wait going on.

	// For systems that cannot know an initial count, this will make the latch 
	// require one more release() call before unblocking. This is not a preferred
	// practice because there is an ABA race condition where between the decision 
	// to go from 1 to 0 to thus trigger the event and actually triggering the 
	// event, another reference may sneak in. This means the system isn't well-
	// behaved and should be programmed to not accept any new references (new 
	// work) while a thread is waiting an any queued tasks to flush. One way to do 
	// this is to keep a scheduling reference separate from any of the work 
	// references and only release the scheduling reference at a time known not to 
	// allow additional work references to be added, such as a frame-to-frame 
	// application.

	// Call this to reduce the number of references keeping the latch locked. The
	// common use case should be to set an initial count of expected work items,
	// then schedule that work asynchronously where each item calls release on the 
	// latch when done. Then in some flush code, wait on the latch and thus when
	// all work is done, all counts on the latch are released and the wait is 
	// unblocked.
