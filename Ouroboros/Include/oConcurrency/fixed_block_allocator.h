// A very simple fixed-size allocator that operates on memory allocated by
// someone else. This uses the oversized-allocation pattern where the memory
// operated on is some large buffer that extends beyond the size of the class
// itself. This allows direct mapping onto memory this class does not own and
// also avoids an indirect of having a pointer in the class itself. Since this
// object is designed to be a very low-level object, the added complexity is
// acceptable for the overhead savings.

// This allocator has O(1) allocation and deallocation time and uses a single
// CAS in each case to enable concurrency.

// There is a generic/void* version and also a templated version below it.
// Because this is used in a grow-by-chunk allocator (block_allocator) redundant 
// data such as block size and number of blocks is not cached by this class.
