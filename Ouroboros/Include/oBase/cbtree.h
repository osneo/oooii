// This header has accessor tools for working with a compact binary tree 
// that is stored as an array where btree[0] is a null/unused entry, 
// btree[1] is the root, btree[2] and btree[3] are the root's childen and 
// so on. To avoid confusion, the term "level" is used rather than depth. 
// There are important properties that occur at levels where the level of 
// the root is 0 rather than its depth which is 1.
//        0        // level-1 unused
//        1        // level0 root
//    2       3    // level1 first 2 children
//  4   5   6   7  // level2 next level after that
// 8 9 A B C D E F // level3 ...
//
// Useful properties:
// o the first node in each level is 2^level
// o the number of nodes in a level is 2^level
// o parents and children are easily accessible by bit-shifts/divides.
//
// Note: No bound checking is done in these functions, i.e. for the 
// above example, asking for the child of C or D will return a value
// though that may be outside of the range prepared by client code.
