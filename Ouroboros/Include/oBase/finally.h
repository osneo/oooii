// A simple class that calls a std::function when the current scope ends. This 
// is useful for using an exit-early-on-failure pattern, but being able to 
// centralize cleanup code without gotos or scope worries. The C++ luminaries 
// are against this pattern because good design should leverage RAII, but how
// does RAII work with std::thread? If client code doesn't explicitly call
// join(), the app just terminates, and there's no thread_guard. So continue to
// favor RAII, but have this fallback just in case.
