  wildcards. If a ? is found then just increment both strings. If

  algorithm gets a little more complicated. As matching
  *zetnet.co.uk to zdialup.zetnet.co.uk would incorrectly return
  false. To solve this i'm keeping a pointer to the string just
  after the last * so that when the two next characters from each
